# Frontend Environment Setup

**IMPORTANT:** Create a file named `.env.local` in the `frontend` directory with the following content:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## How to Create:

1. Navigate to `frontend` folder
2. Create a new file called `.env.local`
3. Add the line above
4. Save the file

This tells the frontend where to find the backend API.
